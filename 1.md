Step-by-Step Process:
Production DB (dSource): The starting point is a production database (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server) or any reference database that you want to virtualize. This is the dSource in Delphix.

Delphix Engine (Virtualization Layer): The Delphix engine connects to the dSource and virtualizes it. It manages the storage and handles the space-efficient provisioning of virtual databases.

Template vDB: You create a Template vDB from the dSource (or an existing vDB). The Template vDB is a read-only, pre-provisioned copy of the dSource that is optimized for fast, space-efficient provisioning.

Container vDB: From the Template vDB, you can create Container vDBs. These are the working, provisioned virtual databases used for development, testing, or QA. These vDBs are modifiable and can be refreshed with the latest data from the Template vDB or dSource.

Working Environment (Container vDBs): Developers or testers use the Container vDBs for their daily work. These can be modified, tested, and refreshed, while the Template vDB remains static as the baseline source.

Refresh/Modification: Container vDBs can be refreshed to bring in the latest data from the Template vDB or dSource, or changes can be rolled back to previous snapshots.

Template vDB: This is essentially a base snapshot of a virtual database (vDB) that you can use to create new vDBs. Think of it as a "template" or a master copy, and you can clone multiple vDBs from it. This is ideal when you want to quickly deploy copies of a certain environment or dataset.

Container vDB: This is a specific vDB that's used for testing or development purposes. It often represents an isolated instance that can be used for testing workflows, software updates, or other activities without affecting production data. It's more like a runtime or "working" copy of the vDB, and you might spin it up and destroy it as needed.


dSource: A read-only copy of the data from a physical database, captured at a specific point in time. It acts as the basis for creating vDBs.

vDB (Virtual Database): A virtualized copy of a dSource or a Template vDB. You can create and manipulate multiple vDBs from a single dSource or Template vDB.
