Step-by-Step Process:
Production DB (dSource): The starting point is a production database (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server) or any reference database that you want to virtualize. This is the dSource in Delphix.

Delphix Engine (Virtualization Layer): The Delphix engine connects to the dSource and virtualizes it. It manages the storage and handles the space-efficient provisioning of virtual databases.

Template vDB: You create a Template vDB from the dSource (or an existing vDB). The Template vDB is a read-only, pre-provisioned copy of the dSource that is optimized for fast, space-efficient provisioning.

Container vDB: From the Template vDB, you can create Container vDBs. These are the working, provisioned virtual databases used for development, testing, or QA. These vDBs are modifiable and can be refreshed with the latest data from the Template vDB or dSource.

Working Environment (Container vDBs): Developers or testers use the Container vDBs for their daily work. These can be modified, tested, and refreshed, while the Template vDB remains static as the baseline source.

Refresh/Modification: Container vDBs can be refreshed to bring in the latest data from the Template vDB or dSource, or changes can be rolled back to previous snapshots.
